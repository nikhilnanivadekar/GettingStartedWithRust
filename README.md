# GettingStartedWithRust

# Abstract

Rust focuses on speed, safety, semantics, and productivity. Rust can be considered a multi-paradigm language. As a Java developer, Nikhil had to learn the same concepts and use them differently. In the 100% hands on talk, Nikhil will explain the basics of Rust, some different yet cool features the sets Rust apart from other programming languages. The audience will learn some of the basic concepts, advantages, disadvantages of Rust and decide if they would like to "Get started with Rust".

# Notes
-  `fn main()` is the entry point of a program.
- Parameters go in parentheses
- `let` is used to define a variable: What about data types?
- `mut` is used to make a variable mutable
  - Immutable by default
- Standard Data Structures: `List`, `Set`, `Map`
- Code Arrangement in Modules
- Inheritance: Struts
- Enums
- Function Access
- Variable Scopes: Reference and value
- Testing

# Naming Conventions
Available here: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html

# Data structures
## Vec
```
let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
for iter in vec.iter(){
    println!("{}", iter);
}
```

## Set
```
let mut set = HashSet::new();
set.insert(1);
set.insert(2);
set.insert(3);
set.insert(3);

for iter in set.iter(){
    println!("{}", iter);
}
```

## Map
```
let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(1, "One");
map.insert(2, "Two");
map.insert(3, "Three");
map.insert(3, "three");

for (key, value) in map {
    println!("Key:{} Value:{}", key, value);
};
```

# Option
- Option is an enum that consists of two values `None`, `Some(T)` where `T` is a generic
- `None` is equivalent to `Optional.empty()` in Java
- Rust does not have a `null`
- `Some(T)` is like `Optional.of(T)` in Java
- Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24772148

```
let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(1, "One");
map.insert(2, "Two");
map.insert(3, "Three");

println!("{:?}", map.get(&1)); // Prints Some("One")
println!("{:?}", map.get(&4)); // Prints None
```

# Ownership
- System of ownership is used for memory management
- Compiler checks for a set of rules: 
  - If any of the rules are violated, it is a compile time error
  - Hence, at runtime ownership does not slow down the execution time
- Ownership helps to develop code that is safe and efficient
- Ownership is one of the concepts that makes Rust unique
- Ref: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html

## Ownership Rules
- Each value in Rust has an owner
- There can only be one owner at a time
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

# Difference between `str` (String Slice) and `String`
- Ref: https://dev.to/dsysd_dev/string-vs-str-in-rust-understanding-the-fundamental-differences-for-efficient-programming-4og8
## Ownership
- `str` is a borrowed reference to a portion of an existing string or string literal, and it does not own the data.
- `String` owns the data it represents and is responsible for its memory allocation and deallocation.
## Allocation
- `str` does not require heap allocation
- `String` is heap allocated

# Re-declaring Variables
- Idiomatic for Rust
- Beneficial in these three cases
  - Convert mutable to immutable
  - Dynamic typing: Rust makes it safe

# Modules
- We need to explicitly build the module tree in Rust, thereâ€™s no implicit mapping to file system
  - Hence, need to define a `mod`
  - Rust makes everything private by default need to open it to public (structs and functions)
  - Need to use the `use` syntax to "import" specific structs

# Visibility
- By default everything is private
- `pub(in path)` makes an item visible within the provided path. path must be an ancestor module of the item whose visibility is being declared.
- `pub(crate)` makes an item visible within the current crate.
- `pub(super)` makes an item visible to the parent module. This is equivalent to pub(in super).
- `pub(self)` makes an item visible to the current module. This is equivalent to pub(in self) or not using pub at all.

# Pattern Matching
- Patterns have to be exhaustive 
```
let x = 1;

match x{
    1 => println!("Odd"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    _ => println!("Nothing")
}
```
