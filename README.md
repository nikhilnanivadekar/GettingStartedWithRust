# GettingStartedWithRust

# Abstract

Rust focuses on speed, safety, semantics, and productivity. Rust can be considered a multi-paradigm language. As a Java developer, Nikhil had to learn the same concepts and use them differently. In the 100% hands on talk, Nikhil will explain the basics of Rust, some different yet cool features the sets Rust apart from other programming languages. The audience will learn some of the basic concepts, advantages, disadvantages of Rust and decide if they would like to "Get started with Rust".

# Notes
-  `fn main()` is the entry point of a program.
- Parameters go in parentheses
- `let` is used to define a variable: What about data types?
- `mut` is used to make a variable mutable
